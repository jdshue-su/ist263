        <h1>About Me -- JDS</h1>
        <p><u><strong> My name is Joe Shue</u></strong>. I live in a small town named Fulton, NY. I work for Syracuse University in the ITS department, specifically the network wiring group. My hobbies include sports, specifically professional and college football and basketball. I follow Syracuse football and basketball very closely, as I have my whole life. <u>I am interested in the process of developing web pages and that is why I enrolled in IST-263!</u></p>
        <p>Since I was a kid hooking up Super Nintendos (since my mom could not figure it out) I have taken an interest in electronics and gadgets. A short time after that, the internet starting becoming what it is today, a massive gathering place for ideas and entertainment. With this, I started taking an interest in everything electronic, and as I got older, I wanted to know how it works. So, after I started here at SU, I started taking different classes to find out how bits and pieces of the internet works, and this is where I am today.</p>
