        <h1>An Orange History</h1>
        
            <p>Syracuse University Football has a long and rich history! We will dive into some of the historical people and places throughout the years. Also, check out the current Orange Football Schedule, along with some ex- Syracuse players who are currently in the NFL and some venues that Syracuse Athletics has called home over the years.

        <h3>SU Football Legends</h3>
            
        <p>
            These are a few Syracuse University Football Legends chosen by me, a lifelong 'Cuse fan, in chronological order.

        <p>
            
                Where to begin? How about here: Jim Brown is considered by many to be the greatest football player to ever live. Jim Brown was a dominant running back for the Orange from '54 to '56. He came to the university at a time of great racial divide in the country, and many people believed that African Americans were not as good as the white athletes. Needless to say, he proved these people wrong in an astounding way, trouncing teams week after week that had no answer for him on defense. After a historic collegiate career at Syracuse, he was selected with the 6th overall pick in the NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns, where he would win a Championship with them in 1964. He is immortalized outside of Ensley Practice Facility with a statue, and will be forever linked with Syracuse University.

        <p>
        "The Elmyra Express." Ernie Davis played for legendary coach Ben Schwartzwalder in 1959, a couple years after the legendary Jim Brown took his talents to the NFL. Ernie had some big shoes to fill, to say the least. It's one thing to follow the likes of a Jim Brown, but the pressure on Ernie must have been immense when his HC gave him Jim Brown's jersey number, the now immortal #44. Whatever lofty expectations Ernie Davis had, he met them, and then some. His sophomore season will go down as Syracuse lore, leading the Orangemen to their first (and only) National Championship in 1960 in the Cotton Bowl win over the Texas Longhorns. If that wasn't enough, Ernie won the Heisman Trophy in 1961, becoming the first African American to do so. Then, he would be drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the 1962 NFL Draft, joining his idol Jim Brown and forming what was potentially the greatest running back duo of all time. This would tragically never come to fruition, as Ernie Davis was diagnosed with Leukemia in 1962 and would pass away in 1963 at the heartbreaking age of 23. His legend will forever live on with 2 statues on campus and a dorm building that bears his name on main campus.

            Good things always come in 3's right? That was the case again here for Syracuse running backs. Floyd would come in after Ernie in 1964, and was even persuaded by Davis to attend Syracuse. Floyd Little had a dominant career for the Orangemen, and in fact was the only 3 time All-American running back the school has ever had! He would be drafted by the Denver Broncos in 1967 and would have a hall of fame career there.

            Larry Legend! Csonka came to Syracuse at the same time as Floyd Little. He came in as a linebacker, but was switched to fullback later. Larry ran like you would expect a linebacker to. Up-the-field running and punishing defenders was the Larry Csonka way, and he is still known as one of the best power running backs of all time. In fact, he's the only NFL player to ever get an unneccesary roughness penalty against a tackler (shown below ;-)) Larry would go on to be drafted by the Miami Dolphins with the 8th overall pick in the '68 draft where he would go on to lead his team to 2 superbowl rings, one being the perfect season of 1972. I was lucky enough to meet him at an autograph signing outside of the Carrier Dome a couple of years back and above is the picture that he signed for me!

        <p>
            McNabb is the greatest overall quarterback that SU has ever seen. He was the prototypical quarterback with the size, strength, speed, and arm talent to make Syracuse Football competitive with any team in the country at that time. #5 was a man of many talents, as he could run and throw the ball equally impressive, as he did in the game pictured above which I was at when I was 12 years old(a beatdown of Miami 66-13.) McNabb would go on to have an incredible career with the Philadelphia Eagles in which he led them to a superbowl in 2004. McNabb would retire with the Vikings but would forever remain a part of Philadelphia sports history as they retired his #5 jersey in 2013.

        <p>
            Eric Dungey is the epitome of what a college quarterback should be. He was not highly touted or recruited. He was once buried on the depth chart. He didn't transfer or complain. He went to work. He played often through injury and made plays that we have not seen since the great Donovan McNabb was on campus. The highlight of the decade that is 2010-2020 was the Camping World Bowl victory over West Virginia, in which Dungey shined, throwing for over 300 yards and a touchdown. Dungey would have short stints with a couple NFL teams but nothing stuck yet. He was a part of the Dallas Renegades in the short-lived XFL, but the league folded up before he could get any action. Dungey will go down in Syracuse lore as a bright spot in a long fruitless search for the next big-time Syracuse quarterback since McNabb's depatrure.

            HONORABLE MENTIONS: Don McPherson was a legend in his own right, and was robbed of the Heisman trophy in 1987. If not for a cowardly tie, he may have played in a national championship game. You can't forget Dwight Freeney, Marvin Harrison, Olindo Mare, or Tim Green, either. All were NFL greats and had superb careers in Syracuse and beyond.
