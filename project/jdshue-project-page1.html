        <h3><strong><u>SU Football Legends</u></strong></h3>
        <p>
            These are a few Syracuse University Football Legends picked by me, a lifelong 'Cuse fan, in chronological order.

        </p>
        
        <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Brown">Jim Brown</a></h4>
        <img src="media/jim-brown-statue2.jpg" alt="Jim Brown" width="500" height ="600" />
        <p>Where to begin? How about here: Jim Brown is considered by many to be the greatest football player to ever live. Jim Brown was a dominant running back for the Orange from '54 to '56. He came to the university at a time of great racial divide in the country, and many people believed that African Americans were not as good as white athletes. Needless to say, he proved these people wrong in an astounding way, trouncing teams week after week that had no answer for him on defense. After a historic collegiate career at Syracuse, he was selected with the 6th overall pick in the NFL Draft by the Cleveland Browns, where he would win a Championship with them in 1964. He is immortalized outside of Ensley Practice Facility with a statue, and will be forever linked with Syracuse University.

        <h4>><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernie_Davis">Ernie Davis</a></h4>

        <p>
        "The Elmyra Express." Ernie Davis played for legendary coach Ben Schwartzwalder in 1959, a couple years after the legendary Jim Brown took his talents to the NFL. Ernie had some big shoes to fill, to say the least. It's one thing to follow the likes of a Jim Brown, but the pressure on Ernie must have been immense when his HC gave him Jim Brown's jersey number, the now immortal #44. Whatever lofty expectations Ernie Davis had, he met them, and then some. His sophomore season will go down as Syracuse lore, leading the Orangemen to their first (and only) National Championship in 1960 in the Cotton Bowl win over the Texas Longhorns. If that wasn't enough, Ernie won the Heisman Trophy in 1961, becoming the first African American to do so. Then, he would be drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the 1962 NFL Draft, joining his idol Jim Brown and forming what was potentially the greatest running back duo of all time. This would tragically never come to fruition, as Ernie Davis was diagnosed with Leukemia in 1962 and would pass away in 1963 at the heartbreaking age of 23. His legend will forever live on with 2 statues on campus and a dorm building that bears his name on main campus.

        <p>
            Good things always come in 3's right? That was the case again here for Syracuse running backs. Floyd would come in after Ernie in 1964, and was even persuaded by Davis to attend Syracuse. Floyd Little had a dominant career for the Orangemen, and in fact was the only 3 time All-American running back the school has ever had! He would be drafted by the Denver Broncos in 1967 and would have a hall of fame career there.

        <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Csonka">Larry Csonka</a></h4>
        <img src="media/larry.jpg" alt="Larry Csonka" width="600" height="500" />
        <p>
            Larry Legend! Csonka came to Syracuse at the same time as Floyd Little. He came in as a linebacker, but was switched to fullback later. Larry ran like you would expect a linebacker to. Up-the-field running and punishing defenders was the Larry Csonka way, and he is still known as one of the best power running backs of all time. In fact, he's the only NFL player to ever get an unneccesary roughness penalty against a tackler (shown below ;-)) Larry would go on to be drafted by the Miami Dolphins with the 8th overall pick in the '68 draft where he would go on to lead his team to 2 superbowl rings, one being the perfect season of 1972. I was lucky enough to meet him at an autograph signing outside of the Carrier Dome a couple of years back and above is the picture that he signed for me!

        <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donovan_McNabb">Donovan McNabb</a></h4>
        <img src="media/donovan.jpg" alt="Donovan McNabb" width="600" height="400" />

        <p>
            McNabb is the greatest overall quarterback that SU has ever seen. He was the prototypical quarterback with the size, strength, speed, and arm talent to make Syracuse Football competitive with any team in the country at that time. #5 was a man of many talents, as he could run and throw the ball equally impressive, as he did in the game pictured above which I was at when I was 12 years old(a beatdown of Miami 66-13.) McNabb would go on to have an incredible career with the Philadelphia Eagles in which he led them to a superbowl in 2004. McNabb would retire with the Vikings but would forever remain a part of Philadelphia sports history as they retired his #5 jersey.

        <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Dungey">Eric Dungey</a></h4>
        <img src="media/dungey.jpg" alt="Eric Dungey" width="600" height="400" />
        <p>
            Eric Dungey is the epitome of what a college quarterback should be. He was not highly touted or recruited. He was once buried on the depth chart. He didn't transfer or complain. He went to work. He played often through injury and made plays that we have not seen since the great Donovan McNabb was on campus. The highlight of the decade that is 2010-2020 was the Camping World Bowl victory over West Virginia, in which Dungey shined, throwing for over 300 yards and a touchdown. Dungey would have short stints with a couple NFL teams but nothing stuck yet. He was a part of the Dallas Renegades in the short-lived XFL, but the league folded up before he could get any action.

        <p>
            HONORABLE MENTIONS: Don McPherson was a legend in his own right, and was robbed of the Heisman trophy in 1987. If not for a cowardly tie, he may have played in a national championship game. You can't forget Dwight Freeney, Marvin Harrison, Olindo Mare, or Tim Green, either. All were NFL greats and had superb careers in Syracuse and beyond.

            <h3><strong><u>The Venues</u></strong></h3>
        <p>
            Syracuse University has played on a few different surfaces throughout it's history, everything from a dirt field to a state-of-the-art facility. Here is a brief history of these stadiums. 
        </p>
        <h4><strong><u>"The Oval"</u></strong></h4>
        <p>
            This was the before-mentioned "dirt field." Syracuse played on "The Oval" from 1895-1907. To say this field was modest would be an understatement. It was basically just a dirt field with an oval around it (hence the name) where the team played it's games for just over a decade. Football itself as a sport was still in it's infancy, so the playing field was built to have the games on, without a whole lot of thought about the fan experience.

        </p>    

        <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archbold_Stadium">Archbold Stadium</a></h4>
        <img src="media/arch-color.jpg" alt="archbold" width="600" height="400" />
        <p>
            Now this is a stadium! Archbold was built in 1907 and replaced the oval in quite a fashion. As seen above, this was clearly built with more fans in mind and was quite a site to see! Arch was nestled right between a few buildings on campus and became a focal point of Syracuse Football, and they spent 73 years playing on this field. This was obviously an outdoor stadium, so someone must have thought that playing outside was just too inconvenient for some people based on the future designs of Syracuse Football venues!
        </p>
        <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_Dome">The Carrier Dome</a></h4>
        <img src="media/carrier dome.jpg" alt="dome" width="700" height="500" />
        <p>
            There's the bubble we all know and love! The iconic Carrier Dome was erected in 1980 and has been home to the Orange right up until this 2020 season. "The Dome" has hosted some incredible events over the past few decades and has been a hot spot for large concerts and massive events like monster truck rallies. Many folks in my generation and after will always have a special place in their hearts for the Carrier Dome and all of the memories that were created there.
        </p>

        <h4>The Stadium</h4>
        <img src="media/stadium.PNG" alt="newdome" width="1000" height="500" /> <br>
        <img src="media/new-dome.jpg" alt="newdomeint" width="1000" height="800"/>    
        <p>
            We don't really know what to call this beauty, yet. For now we will simply call it "The Stadium." This is "The Dome" 2.0. It is esentially a $120 million dollar home renovation of the old building, which includes a new, permanent solid roof (no more bubble). The Stadium still has the old character of the dome but has included some very fancy new amenities including a new sound system and a state of the art jumbotron scoreboard in the middle of the field that even Jerry Jones would be impressed with! This stadium should be in this form for many decades to come and will be home to many future great Syracuse University Football moments to come!
